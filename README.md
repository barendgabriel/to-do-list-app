To-Do List App
This is a simple To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. The app allows users to add tasks to a list, cross them out, delete them, and reorder the tasks using drag-and-drop. The app is also styled with responsive design in mind and features a clean, minimalist UI.

Features
Add Tasks: Users can add tasks by typing them into the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
Cross Out Tasks: Double-clicking any task will cross it out, indicating completion.
Delete Tasks: Users can remove a task by clicking the "X" button next to each task.
Reorder Tasks: Tasks can be dragged and reordered as desired.
Hover Interaction: The delete button ("X") is only visible when hovering over a task, keeping the interface clean.
