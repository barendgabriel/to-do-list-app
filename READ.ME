To-Do List App
Overview
The To-Do List App is a simple task management application built using jQuery. This app allows users to add, delete, cross out, and reorder items on a to-do list. It's designed to be a lightweight and responsive solution for managing daily tasks.

Features
Add New Items:
Users can easily add new items to the list by typing into the input field and clicking the "Add" button. The new task will appear at the bottom of the list.

Cross Out Completed Items:
Items can be crossed out by clicking on them, indicating that the task is complete. The crossed-out items remain on the list unless deleted by the user.

Delete Items:
Each task comes with a delete button ("X") next to it. Users can click this button to remove the task from the list permanently.

Reorder Items:
Users can reorder tasks on the list by dragging and dropping them into a new position. This helps prioritize or reorganize tasks as needed.
